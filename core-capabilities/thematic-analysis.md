# Thematic Analysis Engine

### 2.3 Thematic Analysis Engine

The thematic analysis system represents Rescribos' most sophisticated feature, employing multi-order reasoning to identify trends, implications, and strategic insights.

**Advanced Capabilities:**

**1. Multi-Order Implications**
- **First-Order:** Direct impact and immediate consequences
- **Second-Order:** Downstream effects and ripple impacts
- **Third-Order:** Long-term strategic implications

**2. Dynamic Categorization**
- AI-driven section creation (not pre-defined categories)
- Adaptive taxonomy based on content
- Hierarchical organization (major themes â†’ subtopics)

**3. Hierarchical Clustering**
- Multi-level grouping algorithms
- Relationship mapping between stories
- Distribution optimization for balanced sections

**4. Citation Management**
- Direct article referencing in summaries
- Numbered citations with source tracking
- Markdown link generation

**5. Executive Summary**
- High-level synthesis across all sections
- Key findings with citations
- Actionable recommendations
- Data-driven insights

**Processing Steps:**
```
1. Article Relationship Analysis (cosine similarity matrix)
2. Initial Group Identification (HDBSCAN clustering)
3. Distribution Optimization (balanced sections)
4. Subtopic Creation (recursive clustering)
5. Section Summary Generation (GPT-4o synthesis)
6. Executive Summary Creation (cross-section analysis)
7. Final Review and Refinement (coherence check)
```

**Output Structure:**
```markdown
# Executive Summary
[High-level synthesis with citations]

## Section 1: [AI-Generated Theme Name]
[Section summary with key findings]

### Subtopic 1.1: [Specific Focus]
- **Story 1** [Citation 1]: Summary and implications
- **Story 2** [Citation 2]: Summary and implications

## Section 2: [Another Theme]
...

## References
[1] Title - URL
[2] Title - URL
```

**Performance:**
- Processing time: 5-15 minutes for 100-500 stories
- Quality: PhD-level analysis depth
- Citations: 100% traceable sources
