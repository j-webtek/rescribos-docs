# Core Capabilities

Rescribos is built on five core platform capabilities that transform raw information streams from any source into actionable intelligence. These capabilities are **source-agnostic** and **domain-independent**—they work whether you're processing news feeds, research papers, internal documents, API data, or any combination thereof.

The platform's value lies not in predefined data sources, but in how it processes, analyzes, and makes information accessible through AI-powered workflows.
