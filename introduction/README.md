# Executive Summary

Rescribos Data Refinement streamlines the end-to-end process of monitoring AI-related news. The application captures data from public sources such as Hacker News and arXiv, augments it with locally supplied documents, and runs an AI-assisted analysis pipeline that produces actionable briefings, thematic groupings, and semantic search.

## Challenges Addressed

- **Signal extraction** – Reduce noise from fast-moving feeds through keyword filters, relevance scoring, and duplicate suppression.
- **Analysis turnaround** – Generate executive summaries, impact scores, and theme groupings within minutes, even for large story sets.
- **Research continuity** – Keep the entire workflow local so regulated teams can operate in offline or air-gapped environments.
- **Operational consistency** – Reuse saved configurations, automation scripts, and CLI commands across teams and environments.

## Differentiators

- **Local-first architecture** – All content, embeddings, and reports are written to the operator’s filesystem under `storage/` and `reports/`.
- **Provider flexibility** – Switch between OpenAI GPT-5, Ollama Llama 3.1, and transformer fallbacks without changing workflows.
- **Verified pipeline** – Python scripts share one logging convention and emit structured progress events that the UI and CLI consume.
- **Deep configurability** – Fine-grained environment variables, profiles, and cart presets allow tailored extractions and analyses.
- **Full traceability** – Every report contains provenance metadata, raw story references, and citations for generated statements.
