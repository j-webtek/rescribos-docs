# Value Proposition

Rescribos Data Refinement delivers measurable impact for each stakeholder group that participates in AI-focused research and monitoring.

## Individual Researchers

- **Automate discovery** – Schedule extractions from Hacker News, arXiv, and any additional connectors you generate with the data source template, then review a distilled digest instead of hundreds of raw posts.
- **Accelerate analysis** – Summaries, impact scores, and follow-up prompts are generated in one run, cutting manual synthesis time from hours to minutes.
- **Stay in control of spend** – Bring your own OpenAI key or run everything through local Ollama models when cost or privacy takes priority.
- **Travel-ready workflows** – Offline mode keeps the full toolchain operational during travel or in low-connectivity regions.

## Collaborative Teams

- **Shared context** – Reports, carts, and configuration profiles live in versionable JSON and Markdown, making it easy to hand off work or run follow-up analysis.
- **Repeatable standards** – Prompt templates, environment profiles, and automation scripts enforce consistent outputs regardless of who executes the job.
- **Flexible exports** – PDF for stakeholders, Markdown for knowledge bases, and JSON for analytics stacks ensure everyone receives the right format.
- **CLI + scheduler integration** – Use `npm run cli -- <command>` within cron or CI to deliver daily reports without manual effort.

## Enterprises and Programs

- **On-premises deployment** – Deliver as a desktop app, Docker container, or scripted pipeline with no dependency on external services beyond chosen AI providers.
- **Security posture** – Credentials are stored via Keytar, data lives under `storage/`, and no telemetry is emitted.
- **Compliance assistance** – Documentation maps to GDPR, HIPAA-friendly processing, and NIST-style control checkpoints (see [Privacy & Security](../privacy-security/README.md)).
- **Scalable support** – Integration guides cover CLI automation, IPC events, and document processing so internal teams can extend the solution.

## Regulated and Air-Gapped Environments

- **Zero cloud dependency** – Run entirely on local models when required; license validation supports offline grace periods.
- **Transparent pipeline** – Python workers are open for review and paired with verbose logging for audits.
- **Deterministic configuration** – Profiles make it simple to recreate an analysis with the same parameters for legal or compliance review.

## Indicative ROI

| Activity | Manual effort | With Rescribos | Time saved |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Daily content collection | ~2 hours | < 15 minutes | 1 h 45 m |
| Manual summarisation | ~4 hours | ~30 minutes | 3 h 30 m |
| Theme organisation | ~2 hours | < 20 minutes | 1 h 40 m |
| Report packaging | ~1 hour | < 10 minutes | 50 minutes |

Even a single analyst working a five-day week can reclaim 35–40 hours, turning the annual licence and API costs into a fractional investment.

## Choosing a Path
