### 5.5 Error Handling and Recovery

**Retry Mechanisms:**
```python
async def fetch_with_retry(url, max_attempts=3):
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            response = await fetch(url)
            return response
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                log_error(f"Failed after {max_attempts} attempts: {url}")
                write_to_error_log(url, str(e))
                return None
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

**Error Logging:**
```
logs/
├── extraction_20250115.log    # Source-specific errors
├── analysis_20250115.log      # AI processing errors
├── error_20250115.log         # General application errors
└── performance_20250115.log   # Timing and metrics
```

**Recovery Strategies:**
- **Partial Success:** Continue with available data
- **Provider Failover:** Switch to backup AI provider
- **Checkpoint Saving:** Resume from last successful stage
- **Error Reporting:** Detailed logs for troubleshooting
