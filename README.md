# Introduction

## AI-Powered Knowledge Management & Research Intelligence Platform

**Version 2.0 | October 2025**

Welcome to the Rescribos Data Refinement technical documentation. This comprehensive guide covers everything from system architecture to deployment options for our privacy-first, AI-powered knowledge management platform.

## What is Rescribos?

Rescribos Data Refinement is an enterprise-grade, privacy-first desktop application that transforms how organizations collect, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources. Built on a sophisticated hybrid AI architecture, Rescribos combines the power of cloud-based language models with complete offline capability, giving users unprecedented control over their data while maintaining cutting-edge analytical capabilities.

## Key Features

* **Privacy-First Architecture** - Local-first design with optional cloud processing
* **Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)** - User-controlled API credentials (OpenAI)
* **Hybrid AI Processing** - Seamless cloud/local model switching
* **Multi-Format Export** - PDF, DOCX, Markdown, JSON, Excel
* **Interactive AI Chat** - Natural language Q\&A over collected content
* **Semantic Search** - Vector-based content discovery across reports
* **Document Processing** - PDF, DOCX analysis and integration
* **Thematic Analysis** - Multi-order implications and trend identification

## Quick Start

### For Researchers

1. Download the installer for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Configure your data sources and keywords
3. Run your first extraction and analysis
4. Explore thematic reports and the chat interface

### For Developers

1. Review the [Technical Implementation](technical-implementation/) section
2. Deploy via [Docker](deployment/) or CLI
3. Integrate into your existing workflows
4. Check out the [API documentation](advanced-features/)

### For Enterprise

1. Review [Deployment Options](deployment/)
2. Explore [Privacy & Security](privacy-security/) compliance features
3. Contact sales for site licensing
4. Plan your [deployment architecture](deployment/configuration.md)

## Critical Differentiators

### Privacy-First Design

Unlike SaaS platforms, Rescribos stores 100% of your data locally. No cloud uploads, no vendor lock-in, no data mining. Your research stays on your machine.

### Bring Your Own Keys

You control AI costs directly. Pay OpenAI (or use local models) at cost - no markup, no middleman. Full transparency in your AI usage.

### Hybrid AI Architecture

Work online with GPT-4o or offline with Llama 3.1. Automatic failover ensures you're never blocked. Perfect for air-gapped or sensitive environments.

### Enterprise-Ready

GDPR compliant, HIPAA compatible, FedRAMP considerations included. Complete audit trails, no telemetry, hardware-based licensing.
